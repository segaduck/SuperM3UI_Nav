SuperM3UI
A GUI forntend of Supermodel Emulator

Copyright 2024 Segaduck, Viking254 and The Supermodel Team



Introduction

SuperM3UI is a work-in-progress, open source emulator frontend.
It just provides an optional GUI to control emulator instead of Supermodel's prompt commands,
and it DOES NOT and WILL NOT improve or affect any emulation output in Supermodel emulator.

SuperM3UI GUI will ONLY support xinput controllers because the author only has xbox controllers
and does not have enough time either to finish the dinput and rawinput codes.
If the user has only dinput or rawinput devices, please use the "Config Inputs (command prompt)"
in Config page of SuperM3UI, it will call the Supermodel's "-config-inputs" command and the user
can still set up the dinput and rawinput support inputs as usual.

Disclaimer

Because SuperM3UI is just a casual project for Segaduck to learn how to code in C#, users may
have various bugs. DO NOT expect update or bug fix of SuperM3UI any time soon because the
author will have a very long and busy working time after this release.



Special Thanks

To Vikang. You help me a lot to achieve the xinputs and keysï¼ŒI cannot complete the project so quickly
without your generous contribution of codes and great discussion. Thank you so much again.


Greeting

To Senna. Wish you will conquer the illness ASAP.
God bless you and the best wish from all of us, your best friends and family loving you.
